# Emotional-recognition-chatbot

# ðŸ¤– Satori  
*A Zen chatbot that understands your pain and roasts your bugs.*  

## Features  
- Emotion detection (`happy`, `sad`, `excited`, etc.)  
- Dad jokes *so bad*, they loop back to genius  
- Built by a 13-year-old who *refuses* to use training wheels  

## Why?  
Because the world needs more:  
- **Emotional intelligence** (from robots)  
- **Cringe humor** (from 13-year-olds)  

## Future Goals  
- [ ] Add *"period cramp"* sympathy mode   
- [ ] Integrate with OpenAI (hopefully)
